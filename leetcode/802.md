# 802. Find Eventual Safe States

## Description

In a directed graph, we start at some node and every turn, walk along a directed edge of the graph.  If we reach a node that is terminal (that is, it has no outgoing directed edges), we stop.

Now, say our starting node is eventually safe if and only if we must eventually walk to a terminal node.  More specifically, there exists a natural number K so that for any choice of where to walk, we must have stopped at a terminal node in less than K steps.

Which nodes are eventually safe?  Return them as an array in sorted order.

## Solution

### Note

* **Depth First Research**

  Using colors, 0 -> not visited, 1 -> visited and ggod, 2 -> visited but bad.

  In fact, these denotes three states, not two states just as before like visited -> true ot false.

### Implementation

```cpp
vector<int> eventualSafeNodes(vector<vector<int>>& graph) {
    vector<int> result;
    vector<int> color(graph.size(), 0);
    for (int i = 0; i < graph.size(); i++) {
        if (dfs(graph, i, color)) {
            result.push_back(i);
        }
    }
    return result;
}

bool dfs(vector<vector<int>>& graph, int start, vector<int>& color) {
    if (color[start] != 0) {
        return color[start] == 1;
    }
    // visited but not good
    color[start] = 2;
    for (int i = 0; i < graph[start].size(); i++) {
        if (!dfs(graph, graph[start][i], color)) {
            return false;
        }
    }
    // visited but good
    color[start] = 1;
    return true;
}
```
