# 382. Linked List Random Node

## Description

Given a singly linked list, return a random node's value from the linked list. Each node must have the same probability of being chosen.

What if the linked list is extremely large and its length is unknown to you? Could you solve this efficiently without using extra space?

## Solution

### Note

* **Reservoir Sampling**

### Implementation

```cpp
class Solution {
private:
    ListNode* head;
public:
    Solution(ListNode* head) {
        this->head = head;
    }

    int getRandom() {
        int result = head->val;
        ListNode* cur = head;
        for (int i = 2; cur->next; i++) {
            if ((rand() % i) == 0) {
                result = cur->next->val;
            }
            cur = cur->next;
        }
        return result;
    }
};
```
